Great! The `fastmcp` server is now running correctly on port 8002, and the previous warning has been resolved.

As explained before, the `404 Not Found` errors for `/` and `/favicon.ico` are expected because the `fastmcp` server is not a traditional web server that serves web pages.

You can now interact with the tools exposed by this server using the client example I provided. Run the `fastmcp_client_example.py` file to see the tools in action:

```bash
python fastmcp_client_example.py
```
