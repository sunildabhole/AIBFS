The 404 Not Found errors for `/` and `/favicon.ico` are expected. The `fastmcp` server is not a traditional web server designed to serve web pages. It's an API server that exposes specific "tools" for consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs) or other client applications.

To interact with the tools you've exposed, you need to use a client. I've created an example client file `fastmcp_client_example.py` in your project root.

You can run this example client to see how to call the tools:
```bash
python fastmcp_client_example.py
```
This script will connect to your running `fastmcp` server and call the `user_management_greet` and `user_management_get_user` tools, printing their results.
